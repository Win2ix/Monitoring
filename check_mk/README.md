This location contains all the plugins that we can use with check_mk

The check_mk project was developed by Mathias Kettner and is a collection of plugins for monitoring combining Nagios with pnp4nagios and nagvis.

check_mk by defaults monitors a huge list of services and process.

We at Win2ix Systems have developed small and simple plugins for monitoring applications/services. 

Please make sure that you place the required plugins/files under /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/ and make them executable.
